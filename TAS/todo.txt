Future manual text shit

WAIT

WAIT UNTIL <operation>
 Options:
	START - Waits until the round started
	MOVED - Waits until the client can walk again

WAIT UNTIL <operation> OR IMMEDIATELY
 Usage: Same as WAIT, but won't sleep if the operation is already available. i.e. START, MOVED

KEY_DOWN <keys>
 Usage: sets the client's key presses to everything after KEY_DOWN, excluding semicolon because that's a fucked thing
 - SHIFT, CTRL, ALT can be used as alternatives for those. F1-12 can also be used as alternatives. Separated by spaces.

KEY_UP <keys>
 Usage: Same as KEY_DOWN, but removes the keys.

KEY_PRESS <keys>
 Usage: Essentially runs KEY_DOWN and KEY_UP on the provided keys the next available moment, without having the key loops.

BIND_DOWN <bind datum>, BIND_UP <bind datum>, BIND_PRESS <bind datum>
 Usage: Effectively the same as KEY_DOWN, KEY_UP, and KEY_PRESS, except besides the key it forcefully presses whatever key is associated with the desired binding's path.
